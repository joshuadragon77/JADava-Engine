# JADava-Engine
Forked and Improved Engine from a past project I had with friends in school.

# Summary
The previous engine our group made was called AJK Render Engine. 
Basically, it was suppose to render 2D objects using Java's AWT and Swing Library.

However, it was not as good as I hoped and I planned to take it further by forking it and making it even better.

# Objectives
 - Run without any external third-party libraries. Only using Java's built in library.
 - Can support a verstile of operating systems
 - Reduces CPU Usage by reducing frame rate dynamically
 - Better Optimizing Algorithm


# Other Information
Alongside the AJK Render Engine, I also made the Network Service that allows communication between machines on a network and
the internet. However, it was insecure and uses a simple protocl I made. This will be included in the near future.

I also made the Sound Engine besides the render engine which also needs some improvement. The previous version supports
PlaybackSpeed, Volume, Audio Looping and a simple memory manager for audio. Does not support mp3.

# Future Objectives
 - Showcase this engine's capabilities by making a music video of "Come With Me" by Nitro Fun, Subtact and Anna Yvette with a cool idea I just came with and had to reimagined 10 times cause I like the idea and it is amazing.
 - Maybe make a game using it. :flushed:

ok bye heve fun.
